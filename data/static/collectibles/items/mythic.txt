M20|Zavala's Incredible Speech to Caiatl|Excuse me? One. Fucking. Guardian. Has been kicking your race’s collective asses for 9 years. They kill gods for fun and turn them into guns for a meme. They genocide entire races for loot. They assassinated your last leader, cleaned out your daddy’s ship while he wrote fanfiction about them and promptly fucked off to let you pick up the pieces. The only reason I didn’t bring them here is because they casually began wielding the darkness to clap ass in new ways. All I have to do to make them end you, is to tell them you have a fancy new gun, or that Eris can make you into one. So, think about that before you tell us to bow to your sorry ass.|mythic
